# Coverage Gap Identification

Not every Medicare service has a corresponding [[national-coverage-determinations]] or [[local-coverage-determinations]]. When no explicit policy exists, the MAC makes coverage decisions on a case-by-case basis during [[mac-adjudication]], leading to inconsistent outcomes. Identifying these gaps is valuable for both providers and policy analysts.

## Types of Gaps

- **No NCD, no LCD** — the service has no formal coverage policy at any level; the MAC applies general medical necessity criteria from the statute and IOMs
- **NCD exists, no LCD supplements** — the NCD covers the service broadly, but the MAC hasn't issued an LCD to clarify regional application
- **LCD exists in some jurisdictions but not others** — a direct manifestation of [[payer-rules-fragment-across-jurisdictions]]; providers near jurisdiction boundaries may see different outcomes for the same service
- **Emerging technologies** — new procedures and devices often lack coverage policy until CMS or the MAC evaluates the evidence

## RAG System Application

The RAG system can help identify coverage gaps by allowing users to search for a service and see whether NCD and LCD documents exist in the index. If retrieval returns no coverage policy documents for a specific procedure code, that signals a potential gap. Cross-referencing [[hcpcs-level-ii]] codes against the indexed [[local-coverage-determinations]] and [[national-coverage-determinations]] can systematically surface uncovered services.

## Connections

Coverage gaps increase [[denial-management]] complexity because there are no clear criteria to appeal against. They affect [[revenue-cycle-management]] forecasting because payment outcomes are less predictable. When gaps are identified, providers may request [[cms-role]] issue an NCD or request the [[mac-role]] develop an LCD.
