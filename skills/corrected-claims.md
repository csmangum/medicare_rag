# Corrected Claims

When a claim error is identified — wrong code, missing modifier, incorrect patient information — submitting a corrected claim is often faster and more efficient than filing a formal appeal through the [[medicare-appeals-process]]. A corrected claim replaces the original in the MAC's system.

## Submission

- **Institutional claims** — use Type of Bill (TOB) with frequency code 7 (replacement) or 8 (void); the original claim number (DCN/ICN) must be included
- **Professional claims** — use frequency code 7 in the claim control number field or resubmit with the corrected information per clearinghouse specifications
- **Timing** — corrected claims must still meet the one-year timely filing limit from the original date of service

## When to Use

- The original claim had a coding error (wrong [[hcpcs-level-ii]], [[cpt-codes]], [[icd-10-cm]], or [[modifiers]])
- Patient demographic or insurance information was incorrect
- A charge was missing or duplicated ([[charge-capture]] error)
- The denial reason code indicates a correctable error rather than a coverage dispute

## Connections

Corrected claims are part of the [[claims-lifecycle]] resolution pathway alongside [[denial-management]] and the [[medicare-appeals-process]]. They require accurate [[billing-and-coding]] to avoid creating new errors. Tracking corrected claim volume is a [[rcm-metrics]] indicator of upstream process quality.
