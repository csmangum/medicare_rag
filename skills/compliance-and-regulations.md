# Compliance and Regulations

Medicare billing operates inside a strict regulatory framework. Every claim is a certification that the services were medically necessary, properly documented, and correctly coded. Violations — whether intentional or accidental — carry severe consequences. This regulatory pressure is why [[medicare-is-rules-driven-documentation]] and why tools like the RAG system exist to make the rules accessible.

## Regulatory Bodies

- [[cms-role]] — CMS issues the rules: the Internet-Only Manuals (IOMs), NCDs, transmittals, and Change Requests that define how Medicare operates
- [[oig-role]] — the OIG publishes the annual Work Plan, Compliance Program Guidance, fraud alerts, and Advisory Opinions; it investigates and prosecutes billing fraud
- [[mac-role]] — MACs enforce rules at the claim level and conduct pre-payment and post-payment medical review audits

## Key Laws and Regulations

- [[false-claims-act]] — the primary federal anti-fraud statute; imposes treble damages and per-claim penalties for knowingly submitting false claims; qui tam provisions allow whistleblowers to file on behalf of the government
- [[anti-kickback-statute]] — prohibits offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving anything of value to induce referrals for services covered by federal healthcare programs
- [[stark-law]] — prohibits physician self-referral for designated health services to entities with which the physician has a financial relationship
- [[hipaa-compliance]] — beyond privacy, HIPAA's Administrative Simplification provisions mandate standard transaction formats (837, 835) and code sets that the [[claims-lifecycle]] depends on

## Compliance Programs

- [[compliance-program-elements]] — the seven elements of an effective compliance program: written standards, compliance officer, training, communication, auditing, enforcement, and corrective action
- [[coding-audits]] — internal and external audits that compare coded claims against encounter documentation to detect overcoding, undercoding, and unbundling errors
- [[overpayment-refunds]] — the 60-day rule requires providers to report and refund identified overpayments within 60 days or face False Claims Act liability

## Connections

Compliance constrains every other domain: [[billing-and-coding]] must follow CCI edits and coding guidelines, [[coverage-determination]] policies must be applied accurately, and the [[claims-lifecycle]] must include proper documentation. The RAG system ([[rag-architecture]]) helps compliance teams verify rules quickly, reducing the risk of inadvertent violations.
