# Overpayment Refunds

Under the 60-day rule (42 U.S.C. 1320a-7k(d)), when a provider identifies that it has received an overpayment from Medicare, it must report and return the overpayment within 60 days of identification — or the date any corresponding cost report is due, whichever is later. Failure to do so converts the retained overpayment into a "reverse false claim" under the [[false-claims-act]].

## What Triggers the 60-Day Clock

- **Actual identification** — the provider discovers the specific overpayment (e.g., through a [[coding-audits]] finding)
- **Constructive identification** — the provider should have known about the overpayment through the exercise of reasonable diligence; willful ignorance doesn't stop the clock
- The clock starts when the provider has, or should have, identified the overpayment — not when the provider completes its investigation

## Refund Process

1. **Identification** — through internal audits, external audit findings, billing system reports, or patient/whistleblower complaints
2. **Quantification** — determine the exact overpayment amount using a statistically valid methodology if extrapolating from a sample
3. **Report** — notify CMS or the MAC of the overpayment via the applicable self-disclosure protocol or voluntary refund process
4. **Refund** — return the overpayment amount within the 60-day window

## Connections

The 60-day rule is enforced through the [[false-claims-act]] "reverse false claims" provision. It is triggered by [[coding-audits]] and other monitoring activities within [[compliance-program-elements]]. Overpayment management is a back-end [[revenue-cycle-management]] function tracked in [[collections-and-ar]]. The [[oig-role]] has emphasized the 60-day rule in enforcement actions.
