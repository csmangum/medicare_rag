# Denial Management

Denial management is the systematic process of identifying denied claims, determining root causes, resolving them through corrections or appeals, and implementing changes to prevent recurrence. It is a critical back-end [[revenue-cycle-management]] function and a key indicator of [[billing-and-coding]] quality.

## Denial Categories

- **Coverage denials** — the service is not covered under the applicable [[national-coverage-determinations]] or [[local-coverage-determinations]]; may be appealable
- **Medical necessity denials** — the [[icd-10-cm]] diagnosis code doesn't support the procedure; often fixable with better [[encounter-documentation]] or code selection
- **Coding denials** — incorrect codes, missing [[modifiers]], or CCI edit violations ([[unbundling-and-bundling]])
- **Eligibility denials** — the beneficiary wasn't covered on the date of service; often a front-end [[eligibility-verification]] failure
- **Timely filing denials** — claim submitted after the filing deadline; generally not appealable
- **Duplicate denials** — the MAC flagged the claim as a duplicate of a previously processed claim

## Resolution Workflow

1. Identify the denial from [[remittance-and-payment]] data
2. Classify by denial category and reason code
3. Determine if the claim can be corrected and resubmitted ([[corrected-claims]]) or must be appealed ([[medicare-appeals-process]])
4. Work the denial within the payer's timely filing window for appeals
5. Track the outcome and update denial analytics

## Prevention

The most cost-effective approach to denials is preventing them. This means accurate [[billing-and-coding]], thorough [[eligibility-verification]], clean [[claim-submission]], and proper use of [[advance-beneficiary-notices]]. The RAG system supports prevention by making coverage rules and coding guidance instantly searchable.

## Connections

Denial management consumes significant [[revenue-cycle-management]] resources. Denial patterns reveal systemic issues in [[billing-and-coding]], [[encounter-documentation]], and [[patient-access]]. High denial rates may trigger [[mac-role]] audits and [[compliance-and-regulations]] scrutiny.
