# Anti-Kickback Statute

The Anti-Kickback Statute (42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b) is a criminal statute that prohibits the exchange of anything of value to induce or reward referrals for services covered by Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs. Unlike the [[false-claims-act]], AKS is a criminal law with potential imprisonment.

## Scope

- **Broad reach** — "anything of value" includes money, gifts, discounts, free services, and employment arrangements; "remuneration" is interpreted expansively
- **One purpose test** — if even one purpose of the arrangement is to induce referrals, the AKS is violated, regardless of other legitimate purposes
- **Both sides** — the statute prohibits both offering/paying kickbacks and soliciting/receiving them

## Safe Harbors

CMS and OIG have established safe harbors — specific arrangements that, if structured properly, are protected from AKS prosecution. Examples include:
- Employment relationships
- Personal services and management contracts
- Space and equipment rental at fair market value
- Discounts properly disclosed and reflected in billing
- Electronic health records arrangements

## Connections

AKS violations taint any resulting claims, making them potentially false under the [[false-claims-act]]. The [[oig-role]] issues Advisory Opinions on specific arrangements and publishes fraud alerts about common AKS violations. AKS compliance is a core element of [[compliance-program-elements]]. Relationships between [[billing-and-coding]] entities and referral sources must be structured to comply with AKS.
