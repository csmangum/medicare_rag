# False Claims Act

The False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. 3729-3733) is the most powerful federal tool for combating Medicare fraud. It applies to anyone who knowingly submits a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the federal government, and its penalties are severe enough to drive the entire [[compliance-and-regulations]] infrastructure in healthcare.

## Key Provisions

- **Knowing standard** — the FCA applies when a person "knows or should know" the claim is false; deliberate ignorance and reckless disregard satisfy this standard, so "I didn't know it was wrong" is not a defense
- **Per-claim penalties** — each false claim carries a civil penalty (adjusted annually, currently $13,946–$27,894 per claim) plus treble damages (three times the amount of the false claim)
- **Qui tam provisions** — private citizens (whistleblowers/relators) can file FCA lawsuits on behalf of the government and receive 15-30% of any recovery; this creates powerful incentives for employees to report billing irregularities
- **Reverse false claims** — knowingly concealing or avoiding an obligation to pay money to the government (including [[overpayment-refunds]]) is also an FCA violation

## Common FCA Theories in Medicare

- Billing for services not rendered or not documented ([[encounter-documentation]])
- Upcoding — systematically coding at higher levels than documentation supports
- [[Unbundling-and-bundling]] — billing separately for services that should be bundled
- Billing for medically unnecessary services — violating [[medical-necessity-coding]] requirements
- [[Anti-kickback-statute]] violations — claims tainted by kickback arrangements

## Connections

The FCA is the enforcement mechanism that gives teeth to [[compliance-and-regulations]]. Its penalty structure drives organizations to invest in [[compliance-program-elements]], [[coding-audits]], and [[overpayment-refunds]] programs. FCA investigations are often initiated by the [[oig-role]] or by qui tam relators. The RAG system helps compliance teams verify billing practices against the rules to avoid FCA exposure.
