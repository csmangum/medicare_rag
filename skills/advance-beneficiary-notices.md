# Advance Beneficiary Notices

An ABN is a standardized form (CMS-R-131) that notifies a Medicare beneficiary before receiving a service that Medicare may deny coverage. By signing the ABN, the beneficiary accepts potential financial responsibility. ABNs are required for [[medicare-part-b]] services when the provider has reason to believe Medicare will not pay.

## When Required

- The service is usually covered by Medicare but may not be covered in the specific clinical circumstances
- A [[local-coverage-determinations]] or [[national-coverage-determinations]] frequency limitation has been reached
- The provider believes the service is not medically necessary for the patient's documented condition
- The service is statutorily excluded from Medicare coverage (voluntary/voluntary ABN)

## ABN Requirements

- Must be delivered **before** the service is provided
- Must specify the service, the reason Medicare may not pay, and the estimated cost
- Must give the beneficiary the option to receive the service and be billed, receive the service and have Medicare decide, or refuse the service
- The -GA modifier ([[modifiers]]) is appended to the claim to indicate a signed ABN is on file

## Impact on Claims

If Medicare denies the service and a valid ABN is on file, the provider can bill the beneficiary. Without a valid ABN, the provider must write off the denied amount. This directly affects [[revenue-cycle-management]] and [[collections-and-ar]].

## Connections

ABNs bridge [[coverage-determination]] policy and the [[claims-lifecycle]]. They are required when [[medical-necessity-coding]] may not satisfy LCD/NCD criteria. Failure to issue required ABNs creates [[compliance-and-regulations]] risk. ABN workflows are part of [[patient-access]] front-end operations.
