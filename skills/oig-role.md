# OIG Role

The Office of Inspector General is the primary federal oversight body for Medicare fraud, waste, and abuse. While [[cms-role]] writes the rules and [[mac-role]] processes claims, the OIG investigates whether those rules are being followed and pursues enforcement actions against violators.

## Key Activities

- **Annual Work Plan** — identifies specific billing areas and provider types the OIG will audit in the coming year; billing teams use it to prioritize internal [[coding-audits]]
- **Compliance Program Guidance** — industry-specific guidance on building effective compliance programs (see [[compliance-program-elements]])
- **Fraud alerts** — special bulletins warning about specific billing schemes or arrangements that may violate the [[anti-kickback-statute]] or [[false-claims-act]]
- **Advisory Opinions** — binding opinions on whether specific business arrangements comply with federal fraud and abuse laws
- **Exclusion list** — the List of Excluded Individuals and Entities (LEIE); providers must screen employees and contractors against this list

## Enforcement

The OIG can impose Civil Monetary Penalties, seek exclusion from federal healthcare programs, and refer cases for criminal prosecution. Under the [[false-claims-act]], successful enforcement actions can result in treble damages plus per-claim penalties.

## Connections

The OIG's oversight creates the enforcement pressure that drives [[compliance-and-regulations]] programs. OIG audit targets directly influence [[revenue-cycle-management]] priorities. The RAG system can help compliance teams quickly verify whether a billing practice aligns with published OIG guidance.
