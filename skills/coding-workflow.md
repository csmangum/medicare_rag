# Coding Workflow

The coding workflow is where clinical encounters are translated into standardized billing codes. It sits at the heart of [[revenue-cycle-management]], between [[encounter-documentation]] creation and [[claim-submission]]. Coding accuracy determines whether claims survive [[mac-adjudication]] and avoid [[denial-management]].

## Workflow Steps

1. **Documentation review** — the coder reads the encounter note, operative report, or discharge summary
2. **Diagnosis coding** — assign [[icd-10-cm]] codes for all documented conditions, sequencing the principal/primary diagnosis first
3. **Procedure coding** — assign [[cpt-codes]] and/or [[hcpcs-level-ii]] codes for all documented services, adding [[modifiers]] as needed
4. **Validation** — the billing system applies edits (CCI checks per [[unbundling-and-bundling]], LCD diagnosis pairing per [[medical-necessity-coding]], modifier logic) and flags issues for coder review
5. **Query process** — if documentation is ambiguous, the coder submits a physician query requesting clarification before assigning codes

## Coder Roles

- **Professional coders** — code physician/provider services billed on CMS-1500 ([[claim-forms]])
- **Facility coders** — code hospital inpatient (DRG assignment) and outpatient services billed on UB-04
- **CDI specialists** — Clinical Documentation Improvement staff who work concurrently with physicians to improve documentation specificity (see [[encounter-documentation]])

## Connections

The coding workflow depends on [[encounter-documentation]] quality and produces the coded claims that enter the [[claims-lifecycle]]. It implements [[billing-and-coding]] rules and is the primary target of [[coding-audits]]. The RAG system supports coders by providing instant access to [[coverage-determination]] policies and coding guidelines from [[iom-manuals]].
