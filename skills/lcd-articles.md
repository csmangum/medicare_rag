# LCD Articles

Articles are companion documents to [[local-coverage-determinations]] that provide practical billing and coding guidance without carrying the formal legal weight of an LCD. They help providers translate LCD coverage criteria into correct [[billing-and-coding]] practices.

## Content

- **Billing guidance** — instructions on how to submit claims for services covered by the associated LCD, including required [[modifiers]] and documentation
- **Coding tips** — clarification on which [[hcpcs-level-ii]] or [[cpt-codes]] to use and common coding errors to avoid
- **Utilization parameters** — frequency expectations and clinical thresholds that the MAC considers when reviewing claims
- **FAQ-style content** — answers to common provider questions about the LCD

## Articles in This Project

The RAG system downloads Articles alongside LCDs and NCDs as part of the [[mcd-bulk-data]] set. Each Article is extracted from CSV, stripped of HTML, and stored with metadata (Article_ID, title, jurisdiction). Articles provide complementary context to LCDs during retrieval — when a user asks about billing a specific service, the system can surface both the LCD coverage criteria and the Article's practical guidance.

## Connections

Articles supplement [[local-coverage-determinations]] with actionable billing detail. They reference specific [[hcpcs-level-ii]], [[cpt-codes]], and [[modifiers]]. Article content helps prevent [[denial-management]] issues by clarifying ambiguous LCD language. They are jurisdiction-specific because they are published by MACs ([[mac-role]]).
