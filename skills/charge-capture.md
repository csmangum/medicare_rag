# Charge Capture

Charge capture is the bridge between clinical service delivery and [[billing-and-coding]]. Every procedure, supply, drug, and professional service must be captured accurately and completely before it can be coded and submitted as a claim. Missed charges represent direct revenue leakage in [[revenue-cycle-management]].

## Methods

- **Charge entry** — manual entry of charges by clinical staff into the billing system based on procedure logs, supply sheets, and medication administration records
- **Charge description master (CDM)** — the facility's internal mapping of services to [[hcpcs-level-ii]] and [[cpt-codes]]; maintaining an accurate CDM is critical for automated charge capture
- **EHR-integrated capture** — modern EHR systems can auto-generate charges from orders and clinical documentation, reducing missed charges
- **Late charges** — services captured after the initial claim has been billed require claim adjustments, adding cost to the [[claims-lifecycle]]

## Common Leakage Points

- Supplies and implants used during procedures but not recorded
- Infusion drugs (J-codes) administered but not linked to the billing record
- Professional services provided in hospital settings where the facility and physician bill separately
- Observation hours not tracked accurately

## Connections

Charge capture feeds the coding workflow in [[revenue-cycle-management]]. Inaccurate captures create errors in [[claim-submission]] and may trigger [[compliance-and-regulations]] issues if services are billed that weren't provided (or vice versa). The charges captured must align with [[encounter-documentation]] to survive [[coding-audits]].
