# Medicare Part B

Part B is Medicare's medical insurance component. Unlike [[medicare-part-a]], Part B requires a monthly premium and covers the professional and outpatient services that make up the majority of Medicare claims volume. Most [[hcpcs-level-ii]] codes and all [[cpt-codes]] are billed under Part B.

## Covered Services

- **Physician services** — office visits, consultations, surgical procedures, and diagnostic interpretations billed on CMS-1500/837P
- **Outpatient hospital services** — emergency department visits, observation stays, ambulatory surgery, and outpatient diagnostic services
- **Preventive services** — the Welcome to Medicare visit, Annual Wellness Visit, cancer screenings, immunizations, and other preventive benefits with specific frequency limitations
- **Durable Medical Equipment (DME)** — wheelchairs, hospital beds, oxygen equipment, CPAP/BiPAP, and other devices rented or purchased under DME MAC rules; coded with [[hcpcs-level-ii]] E-codes and K-codes
- **Clinical laboratory tests** — diagnostic blood work, urinalysis, and pathology services paid under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule
- **Drugs administered by physicians** — Part B covers drugs that are not self-administered (injectable drugs, infusion therapy) coded with J-codes under [[hcpcs-level-ii]]

## Cost Sharing

After meeting the annual deductible, beneficiaries typically pay 20% coinsurance for Part B services. There is no annual out-of-pocket maximum in traditional Medicare, which is why many beneficiaries enroll in supplemental (Medigap) plans or [[medicare-part-c]] Medicare Advantage.

## Connections

Part B is the primary domain for [[billing-and-coding]] activities in physician practices and outpatient facilities. Part B claims are adjudicated by MACs ([[mac-role]]) against the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS) and applicable [[local-coverage-determinations]]. The RAG system's code enrichment ([[semantic-enrichment-pipeline]]) primarily enhances Part B code documents.
