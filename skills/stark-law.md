# Stark Law

The Stark Law (42 U.S.C. 1395nn) is a strict-liability statute that prohibits physicians from making referrals for certain designated health services (DHS) to entities with which the physician (or an immediate family member) has a financial relationship, unless an exception applies. Unlike the [[anti-kickback-statute]], Stark is a strict-liability law — intent doesn't matter.

## Designated Health Services

Stark applies to referrals for:
- Clinical laboratory services
- Physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology
- Radiology and imaging services (MRI, CT, ultrasound)
- Radiation therapy
- DME and supplies (coded with [[hcpcs-level-ii]] E-codes and K-codes)
- Home health services
- Outpatient prescription drugs
- Inpatient and outpatient hospital services

## Exceptions

Key exceptions that allow referrals despite a financial relationship:
- In-office ancillary services (services provided in the physician's own office)
- Employment relationships
- Personal services arrangements at fair market value
- Physician recruitment in underserved areas
- Electronic health records donations

## Consequences

Claims submitted in violation of Stark must be refunded. Knowing violations can trigger [[false-claims-act]] liability. The referring physician and the entity may be excluded from Medicare. There is no intent requirement — even inadvertent violations require correction.

## Connections

Stark Law constrains the financial relationships between physicians and the entities to which they refer for DHS. It intersects with [[billing-and-coding]] because the violation renders the claim non-payable. Stark compliance is a focus of [[compliance-program-elements]] and [[oig-role]] enforcement. The RAG system can surface Stark-related guidance from [[iom-manuals]] and CMS transmittals.
