# CMS Role

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services is the federal agency within the Department of Health and Human Services that administers Medicare, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program, and the Healthcare.gov marketplace. For this skill graph, CMS is the ultimate authority on Medicare rules.

## Key Functions

- **National policy** — CMS issues [[national-coverage-determinations]], fee schedules, and Change Requests that define what Medicare covers and how much it pays
- **Internet-Only Manuals** — CMS publishes the IOMs (100-01 through 100-08) that contain the operational rules for Medicare; the RAG system ingests 100-02 (Benefits Policy), 100-03 (NCD), and 100-04 (Claims Processing) via [[iom-manuals]]
- **MAC oversight** — CMS contracts with MACs ([[mac-role]]) to process claims and awards these contracts through competitive bidding
- **Quality programs** — CMS administers MIPS, APMs, and other quality programs that affect physician reimbursement
- **Rulemaking** — the annual MPFS Final Rule, OPPS Final Rule, and other regulations update payment rates, policy changes, and coding updates for the coming calendar year

## Connections

CMS policy decisions flow downstream to [[mac-role]] enforcement, [[national-coverage-determinations]], and the [[claims-lifecycle]]. The IOMs published by CMS are a primary data source for the RAG system ([[download-pipeline]]). CMS also delegates enforcement authority to the [[oig-role]] for fraud and abuse.
