# Encounter Documentation

The encounter note is where clinical care becomes a billable event. Every [[icd-10-cm]] and [[hcpcs-level-ii]] code on a claim must be supported by documentation in the medical record. [[Documentation-quality-determines-revenue]] because coders can only code what the physician documents, and auditors can only defend what the record shows.

## Documentation Requirements

- **Chief complaint and history** — the reason for the encounter and relevant clinical background
- **Examination findings** — physical exam elements or review of diagnostic results
- **Medical decision making** — the assessment, differential diagnoses considered, treatment plan, and rationale; this drives E/M level selection for [[cpt-codes]]
- **Procedure details** — for surgical or diagnostic procedures, the operative report must describe the technique, findings, and any complications
- **Time documentation** — when E/M level is based on total time rather than MDM complexity

## Clinical Documentation Improvement (CDI)

CDI programs deploy clinical documentation specialists who review records concurrently (during the stay) or retrospectively (after discharge) to ensure documentation specificity. CDI is a mid-cycle [[revenue-cycle-management]] function that directly addresses [[code-specificity-reduces-denials]] by prompting physicians to clarify ambiguous documentation.

## Connections

Encounter documentation feeds [[billing-and-coding]] by providing the clinical detail that coders translate into codes. It supports [[medical-necessity-coding]] by linking the diagnosis to the service. It is the evidence reviewed during [[coding-audits]] and [[medicare-appeals-process]]. The RAG system helps documentation specialists verify coding rules against [[iom-manuals]] and [[coverage-determination]] policies.
