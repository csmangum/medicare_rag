# Compliance Program Elements

The [[oig-role]] has published Compliance Program Guidance for various healthcare provider types, all built around seven fundamental elements. Having an effective compliance program can mitigate penalties under the [[false-claims-act]] and demonstrate good faith in regulatory investigations.

## The Seven Elements

1. **Written policies and procedures** — formal standards of conduct and billing policies that address known risk areas in [[billing-and-coding]], [[coverage-determination]], and the [[claims-lifecycle]]
2. **Compliance officer and committee** — a designated individual with authority and resources to manage the compliance program, supported by a committee representing key departments
3. **Training and education** — regular training for all staff on compliance obligations, [[billing-and-coding]] rules, and new regulatory requirements; the RAG system can serve as a training resource by providing instant access to CMS rules
4. **Effective communication** — open lines for reporting compliance concerns, including anonymous hotlines; protection against retaliation for good-faith reports
5. **Internal monitoring and auditing** — regular [[coding-audits]], claim reviews, and risk assessments to detect compliance issues before regulators do
6. **Enforcement through disciplinary guidelines** — consistent consequences for compliance violations, from counseling to termination, applied regardless of the employee's position
7. **Prompt response and corrective action** — when issues are found, investigate promptly, take corrective action, and self-disclose to CMS/OIG when appropriate (including [[overpayment-refunds]])

## Connections

Compliance programs operationalize [[compliance-and-regulations]] requirements. They protect against [[false-claims-act]], [[anti-kickback-statute]], and [[stark-law]] liability. [[Coding-audits]] are the monitoring mechanism. The RAG system supports elements 1 (policy reference), 3 (training), and 5 (auditing) by making CMS rules searchable.
