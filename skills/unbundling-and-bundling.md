# Unbundling and Bundling

The Correct Coding Initiative (CCI) is a CMS program that defines pairs of procedure codes that should not normally be billed together because one is a component of the other. Billing them separately (unbundling) inflates reimbursement and is a compliance risk under [[compliance-and-regulations]].

## CCI Edit Types

- **Column 1 / Column 2 edits** — the Column 2 code is a component of the Column 1 code and should not be billed separately; some pairs allow the -59 modifier ([[modifiers]]) to indicate the services were truly distinct
- **Mutually exclusive edits** — two codes that would never reasonably be performed together on the same patient on the same date
- **Add-on code edits** — codes that can only be billed with a primary procedure code

## Unbundling as Fraud

Deliberate unbundling — billing separately for services that should be billed as a single comprehensive code — is a form of billing fraud under the [[false-claims-act]]. The [[oig-role]] Work Plan regularly identifies specific code pairs that are frequently unbundled, making this a priority for [[coding-audits]].

## Bundling Awareness in Coding

Coders must understand CCI edits to avoid both over-billing (unbundling) and under-billing (failing to use modifier -59 when services are legitimately separate). The [[claims-lifecycle]] includes claim scrubbing against CCI edits before submission.

## Connections

CCI edits directly affect [[billing-and-coding]] workflows. They are enforced during [[mac-adjudication]] and are a focus of [[compliance-and-regulations]]. The RAG system can surface CCI-related guidance from [[iom-manuals]] (IOM 100-04, Claims Processing Manual).
