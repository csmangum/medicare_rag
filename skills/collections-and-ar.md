# Collections and A/R

Accounts receivable management is the final stage of [[revenue-cycle-management]], where unpaid balances are pursued, patient responsibilities are collected, and uncollectible amounts are written off. Days in A/R is the primary measure of financial health for a healthcare organization.

## A/R Management

- **A/R aging buckets** — claims are categorized by age (0-30, 31-60, 61-90, 90-120, 120+ days); older balances are harder to collect and may indicate systemic issues
- **Insurance A/R** — unpaid amounts from Medicare or other payers; may indicate [[denial-management]] backlogs or [[claim-submission]] delays
- **Patient A/R** — deductibles, coinsurance, and non-covered services; Medicare patients may have supplemental insurance (Medigap) that covers some of these amounts
- **Credit balances** — overpayments that must be refunded; Medicare overpayments must be refunded within 60 days under [[overpayment-refunds]]

## Collection Activities

- Patient statements and payment reminders
- Payment plan arrangements
- Financial assistance screening
- Bad debt write-off (after exhausting collection efforts)
- Agency referral for delinquent accounts

## Connections

Collections is the final step in the [[claims-lifecycle]]. A/R aging is a key [[rcm-metrics]] indicator. High A/R balances in insurance buckets signal problems in [[claim-submission]], [[denial-management]], or [[mac-adjudication]]. Patient A/R connects to [[advance-beneficiary-notices]] and financial counseling in [[patient-access]].
