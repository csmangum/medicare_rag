# CPT Codes

Current Procedural Terminology is the procedure coding system maintained by the American Medical Association. CPT codes are 5-digit numeric codes that describe medical, surgical, and diagnostic services performed by physicians and other healthcare professionals. In the HCPCS hierarchy, CPT is Level I, while the alphanumeric codes maintained by CMS are [[hcpcs-level-ii]].

## Categories

- **Category I** — the main body of CPT; includes Evaluation and Management (E/M: 99201–99499), Anesthesia (00100–01999), Surgery (10000–69990), Radiology (70000–79999), Pathology/Lab (80000–89999), and Medicine (90000–99199)
- **Category II** — supplemental tracking codes for performance measurement; not required for billing
- **Category III** — temporary codes for emerging technologies and services; used for data collection until a Category I code is established

## E/M Coding

Evaluation and Management codes are the most frequently billed CPT codes in the Medicare program. The 2021 E/M guideline overhaul shifted office/outpatient visit level selection from the 1995/1997 documentation guidelines to Medical Decision Making (MDM) complexity or total time, reducing documentation burden while maintaining [[medical-necessity-coding]] requirements.

## Relationship to HCPCS

CPT codes are technically HCPCS Level I. When a service is described by both a CPT code and a [[hcpcs-level-ii]] code, the CPT code generally takes precedence for [[medicare-part-b]] claims. CMS may assign different payment rates or coverage rules to the CPT version versus the HCPCS version.

## Connections

CPT codes are the primary procedure codes on professional claims in the [[claims-lifecycle]]. They must be paired with [[icd-10-cm]] diagnosis codes and may require [[modifiers]] for accurate billing. CPT codes are evaluated against [[coverage-determination]] policies. The RAG system does not currently ingest the CPT code file (it is proprietary/licensed by the AMA), but it ingests the CMS-maintained [[hcpcs-level-ii]] codes and IOM references that describe CPT-related billing rules.
