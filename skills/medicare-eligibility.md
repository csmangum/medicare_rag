# Medicare Eligibility

Eligibility determines who can enroll in Medicare and under which parts. Verifying eligibility is a critical [[revenue-cycle-management]] front-end step because billing Medicare for ineligible patients creates claim denials and potential [[compliance-and-regulations]] issues.

## Pathways

- **Age 65+** — U.S. citizens and permanent residents who have lived in the U.S. for at least 5 continuous years become eligible for [[medicare-part-a]] (premium-free if they or their spouse paid FICA taxes for 40+ quarters) and may enroll in [[medicare-part-b]]
- **Disability** — individuals under 65 who have received Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) for 24 months automatically enroll in Parts A and B; the 24-month waiting period is a coverage gap that may affect [[claims-lifecycle]] timing
- **End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)** — individuals of any age with permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or transplant; eligibility may begin based on dialysis start date
- **Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)** — automatic enrollment in Parts A and B in the month SSDI benefits begin, with no waiting period

## Medicare as Secondary Payer

When a beneficiary has other insurance coverage (employer group health plan, auto insurance, workers' compensation), Medicare may be the secondary payer. The Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) rules determine the payment order, and billing the wrong payer first causes claim rejections.

## Connections

Eligibility verification is the first checkpoint in [[patient-access]] and the [[claims-lifecycle]]. Eligibility status determines which Medicare part covers a service, directly affecting [[billing-and-coding]] requirements. The RAG system's IOM 100-02 content ([[iom-manuals]]) includes detailed eligibility and benefit-period rules.
