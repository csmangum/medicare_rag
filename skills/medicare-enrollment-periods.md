# Medicare Enrollment Periods

Enrollment periods define the windows during which beneficiaries can sign up for Medicare or change their coverage selections. Missing enrollment windows can result in gaps in coverage and late-enrollment penalties, which affect both the beneficiary and the provider's ability to bill Medicare.

## Enrollment Windows

- **Initial Enrollment Period (IEP)** — a 7-month window around the beneficiary's 65th birthday (3 months before, the birth month, 3 months after) for enrolling in [[medicare-part-b]] and [[medicare-part-d]]
- **General Enrollment Period (GEP)** — January 1 through March 31 each year for beneficiaries who missed their IEP; coverage begins July 1 and a late-enrollment penalty may apply
- **Special Enrollment Period (SEP)** — triggered by qualifying life events such as losing employer coverage, moving, or qualifying for Extra Help; allows enrollment outside standard windows
- **Open Enrollment Period (OEP)** — October 15 through December 7 for changing [[medicare-part-c]] and [[medicare-part-d]] plans; also the Medicare Advantage Open Enrollment Period (January 1-March 31) for switching MA plans or returning to Original Medicare

## Impact on RCM

Enrollment timing affects [[eligibility-verification]] at the front end of [[revenue-cycle-management]]. A beneficiary who is between enrollment periods may have a coverage gap, making Medicare claims ineligible. Understanding enrollment periods helps [[patient-access]] teams advise beneficiaries and avoid unbillable services.

## Connections

Enrollment periods are defined in CMS regulations that the RAG system can surface from [[iom-manuals]]. They connect to [[medicare-eligibility]] (prerequisite for enrollment) and [[revenue-cycle-management]] (operational impact of coverage gaps).
