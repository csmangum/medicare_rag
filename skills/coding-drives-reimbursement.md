# Coding Drives Reimbursement

This is a core synthesis claim: in the Medicare system, no matter how medically appropriate a service is, payment depends on the codes submitted on the claim. The code determines what fee schedule applies, what coverage policy is evaluated, and whether the claim is paid.

## The Translation Chain

1. A physician provides clinical care and documents it ([[encounter-documentation]])
2. A coder translates the documentation into [[icd-10-cm]] diagnosis codes and [[hcpcs-level-ii]] / [[cpt-codes]] procedure codes
3. The codes are placed on a [[claim-forms]] and submitted ([[claim-submission]])
4. The MAC ([[mac-adjudication]]) evaluates the codes against [[coverage-determination]] policies
5. If the codes satisfy the policy, the claim is paid at the rate determined by the procedure code and fee schedule

Every step in this chain is a translation — from clinical reality to standardized codes to financial outcome. Errors at the coding step propagate to every downstream step.

## Why This Matters

- [[Code-specificity-reduces-denials]] because more specific codes better match coverage policy criteria
- [[Medical-necessity-coding]] is the pairing of diagnosis and procedure codes that must satisfy the coverage policy
- [[Unbundling-and-bundling]] rules determine which code combinations are valid
- The [[semantic-enrichment-pipeline]] in the RAG system exists specifically because the gap between natural-language queries and code descriptions is a retrieval challenge

## Connections

This claim connects [[billing-and-coding]] to [[revenue-cycle-management]] and [[coverage-determination]]. It explains why [[coding-workflow]], [[coding-audits]], and coder education are high-ROI investments. It is a consequence of [[medicare-is-rules-driven-documentation]] and a prerequisite for understanding the [[claims-lifecycle]].
