# Prior Authorization

Prior authorization (PA) is a utilization management tool where the payer must approve a service before it is rendered. While Original Medicare has limited PA requirements, [[medicare-part-c]] plans extensively use PA, and CMS has expanded PA pilots for certain Part B services like repetitive scheduled non-emergent ambulance transports and certain DME items.

## Process

1. The provider identifies that the planned service requires PA based on the payer's requirements
2. A PA request is submitted with clinical documentation supporting [[medical-necessity-coding]]
3. The payer reviews the request against their coverage criteria (which may differ from [[national-coverage-determinations]] and [[local-coverage-determinations]] for MA plans)
4. The payer approves, denies, or requests additional information
5. If approved, the authorization number is included on the [[claim-forms]] at [[claim-submission]]

## Impact on Revenue Cycle

Missing a PA requirement results in an automatic denial at [[mac-adjudication]] that is difficult to overturn. PA management adds administrative cost and time to [[revenue-cycle-management]], but the cost of a denial far exceeds the cost of obtaining the authorization. Tracking PA requirements across multiple payers — especially multiple MA plans — is a significant operational challenge.

## Connections

PA is a [[patient-access]] function that prevents [[denial-management]] downstream. It relies on [[encounter-documentation]] and [[medical-necessity-coding]] to justify the service. PA requirements vary by payer, adding to the burden described in [[payer-rules-fragment-across-jurisdictions]]. CMS rulemaking on PA standardization is tracked via [[cms-role]] transmittals.
