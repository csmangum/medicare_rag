# Denial Prevention

Preventing denials is more cost-effective than working them after the fact. Each denied claim costs $25-$118 to rework (MGMA estimates), and many denials are never recovered. Denial prevention is the strategic complement to [[denial-management]] and the highest-ROI investment in [[revenue-cycle-management]].

## Prevention Strategies

- **Root cause analysis** — categorize denials by type, payer, provider, and service line to identify patterns; a spike in [[medical-necessity-coding]] denials for a specific LCD suggests a [[coverage-determination]] change
- **Front-end verification** — improve [[eligibility-verification]] and [[prior-authorization]] processes to eliminate eligibility and authorization denials before services are rendered
- **Coder education** — targeted training on high-denial code pairs, [[modifiers]] usage, and [[unbundling-and-bundling]] rules; the RAG system can surface the specific [[local-coverage-determinations]] and [[iom-manuals]] references that coders need
- **CDI programs** — Clinical Documentation Improvement ensures that [[encounter-documentation]] supports the codes billed, addressing the root cause of documentation-based denials
- **Claim scrubbing** — enhanced pre-submission edits that catch errors before [[claim-submission]]
- **Payer policy monitoring** — tracking LCD/NCD changes and communicating them to coding and billing teams; the RAG system's indexed [[mcd-bulk-data]] makes policy changes discoverable

## Connections

Denial prevention spans the full [[revenue-cycle-management]] cycle from [[patient-access]] through [[claim-submission]]. It depends on [[rcm-metrics]] for data-driven prioritization. It reduces [[denial-management]] workloads and improves [[collections-and-ar]] outcomes. Systematic prevention also reduces [[compliance-and-regulations]] risk by eliminating patterns that trigger [[oig-role]] audits.
