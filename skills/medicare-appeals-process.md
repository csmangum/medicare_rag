# Medicare Appeals Process

When a Medicare claim is denied, providers and beneficiaries have the right to appeal through a structured five-level process. Each level has strict filing deadlines and progressively higher standards of review. Understanding this process is essential for [[denial-management]] because many initial denials are overturned on appeal.

## The Five Levels

1. **Redetermination (MAC)** — filed within 120 days of the initial determination; the MAC reviews the claim with any additional documentation; turnaround is 60 days
2. **Reconsideration (QIC)** — filed within 180 days of the Redetermination decision; a Qualified Independent Contractor reviews the case independently of the MAC; 60-day turnaround
3. **ALJ Hearing** — filed within 60 days of the Reconsideration decision; requires a minimum amount in controversy; an Administrative Law Judge conducts a hearing (in-person, video, or telephone)
4. **Medicare Appeals Council** — filed within 60 days of the ALJ decision; the Departmental Appeals Board reviews the ALJ's decision; can affirm, reverse, or remand
5. **Federal District Court** — filed within 60 days of the Appeals Council decision; requires a minimum amount in controversy; judicial review of the administrative record

## Documentation at Each Level

Success in appeals depends on the quality of documentation submitted. The [[encounter-documentation]] supporting [[medical-necessity-coding]] is reviewed at every level. Additional clinical evidence (peer-reviewed literature, specialist opinions) can be submitted to support the case.

## Connections

The appeals process is the resolution mechanism for the [[claims-lifecycle]] when [[mac-adjudication]] results in a denial. It is used when [[denial-management]] determines a denial is incorrect. Appeals volume is a [[rcm-metrics]] data point. The RAG system can help appeals teams find relevant [[national-coverage-determinations]], [[local-coverage-determinations]], and IOM references ([[iom-manuals]]) to support their case.
