# Medicare Fundamentals

Medicare is the federal health insurance program for people 65 and older, certain younger people with disabilities, and people with End-Stage Renal Disease. Understanding the program's structure is prerequisite to every other skill in this graph because [[coding-drives-reimbursement]] and every code must be evaluated against the part of Medicare that covers it.

## Program Structure

- [[medicare-part-a]] — hospital insurance covering inpatient stays, skilled nursing facilities, hospice, and some home health; funded primarily through payroll taxes
- [[medicare-part-b]] — medical insurance covering physician services, outpatient care, preventive services, and durable medical equipment; funded through premiums and general revenue
- [[medicare-part-c]] — Medicare Advantage plans offered by private insurers that bundle Part A and B (and often D) with additional benefits; relevant because [[payer-rules-fragment-across-jurisdictions]]
- [[medicare-part-d]] — prescription drug coverage administered through private plans; intersects with Part B when drugs are administered by physicians

## Administration

- [[cms-role]] — the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services sets national policy, publishes the Internet-Only Manuals, and oversees the entire program
- [[mac-role]] — Medicare Administrative Contractors process claims regionally and publish [[local-coverage-determinations]] that create jurisdiction-specific rules
- [[oig-role]] — the Office of Inspector General audits billing patterns, publishes fraud alerts, and enforces [[compliance-and-regulations]]

## Eligibility and Enrollment

- [[medicare-eligibility]] — age-based, disability-based, and ESRD pathways into the program, plus coordination-of-benefits rules when Medicare is secondary
- [[medicare-enrollment-periods]] — Initial Enrollment, General Enrollment, Special Enrollment, and Open Enrollment windows that determine when beneficiaries can change coverage

## Connections

Understanding fundamentals flows directly into [[billing-and-coding]] because each Medicare part has its own fee schedule and covered-service definitions, and into [[coverage-determination]] because NCDs and LCDs specify what each part will pay for.
