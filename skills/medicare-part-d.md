# Medicare Part D

Part D provides outpatient prescription drug coverage through private Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs) or as part of [[medicare-part-c]] Medicare Advantage plans. It was established by the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 and represents a distinct coverage domain with its own rules separate from [[medicare-part-b]] drug coverage.

## Structure

- **Formularies** — each Part D plan maintains a formulary (list of covered drugs) organized into tiers with different cost-sharing; drugs not on formulary may require exception requests
- **Coverage phases** — the Part D benefit has four phases: deductible, initial coverage, coverage gap (formerly "donut hole"), and catastrophic coverage; cost-sharing changes at each phase
- **Part B vs Part D** — drugs administered by a physician in an office or outpatient setting are typically Part B (coded with [[hcpcs-level-ii]] J-codes), while self-administered prescription drugs are Part D; the distinction is clinically and financially significant

## Connections

Part D intersects with [[billing-and-coding]] when determining whether a drug is Part B or Part D covered. It adds complexity to [[revenue-cycle-management]] for facilities that operate both infusion centers (Part B drugs) and retail/specialty pharmacies (Part D drugs). Part D plan rules add to the [[payer-rules-fragment-across-jurisdictions]] challenge.
