# Coding Audits

Coding audits are systematic reviews of coded claims against their source documentation ([[encounter-documentation]]) to verify that the [[billing-and-coding]] is accurate, complete, and compliant. They are the primary monitoring mechanism within [[compliance-program-elements]].

## Audit Types

- **Internal prospective audits** — review claims before submission to catch errors; reduces [[denial-management]] workloads but adds to the coding timeline
- **Internal retrospective audits** — review submitted/paid claims to identify patterns of error; results drive coder education and process improvement
- **External audits** — conducted by independent auditors, RAC (Recovery Audit Contractor), CERT (Comprehensive Error Rate Testing), or [[mac-role]] medical review; these carry financial consequences
- **Focused audits** — target specific high-risk areas identified by [[oig-role]] Work Plan priorities, denial patterns, or internal data analysis

## What Auditors Look For

- **Overcoding** — selecting a higher-complexity E/M level or more specific procedure code than documentation supports
- **Undercoding** — leaving money on the table by coding below what documentation supports (also a compliance issue because it can skew utilization data)
- **Unbundling** — billing separately for services that should be bundled ([[unbundling-and-bundling]])
- **Missing documentation** — codes assigned without supporting documentation, violating "if it's not documented, it didn't happen"
- **Modifier misuse** — inappropriate use of [[modifiers]] to bypass edits or inflate payment

## Connections

Audits are a core component of [[compliance-program-elements]]. They verify the accuracy of the [[coding-workflow]] and the quality of [[encounter-documentation]]. Audit findings inform [[denial-prevention]] strategies. External audit findings can trigger [[false-claims-act]] exposure if patterns of knowing violations are identified.
